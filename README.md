# openGLgeometry
CPSC-453: Computer Graphics Assignment #1.

Platform:
=========
OS X 10.11.6 (El Capitan)

Compiler:
=========
g++

How to run the program:
======================= 
> make; ./main

How to use the program:
=======================
1. Program automatically starts with part I, with 1 level (Square and Diamond)
2. To switch between parts of the assignment:
    - Type 'a' to load the Part I: Squares and Diamonds
    - Type 'b' to load Part II: Parametric Spirals
    - Type 'c' to load Part III: Sierpinski Triangle
3. To switch between levels or revolutions on each part for the shape, type
any digit from 1 to 6. For example, if you have the spiral displayed and you
want to obtain a Spiral with 3 revolutions, type '3'.

Note: When switching between scenes from parts of the assignment the program 
will keep the number of levels previously assigned. For example, when switching
from Spirals with 3 revolution to the Sierpinski triangles, the triangles will
load on iteration 3.
